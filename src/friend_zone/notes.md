Ideas
- use mcstatus to monitor minecraft server https://github.com/Dinnerbone/mcstatus 
- create a small website with fastapi to stand up/tear down servers https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/https/ 
- only run one server at a time?
- use traefik for web engine https://traefik.io/ 
- probs no gunicorn for now, wont have tons of users
- well maybe just use this https://github.com/tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi-docker
